# Keylogger Educational Project (Python)

This project demonstrates a basic keylogger implemented in Python, designed for educational and authorized security research purposes only. It consists of two components:

* `Untitled.py`: Client script that captures keystrokes and sends them to a server.
* `Untitled2.py`: Flask server that receives and logs the keystrokes.

## Files

* `Untitled.py`: Simulates a game window and runs the keylogger in the background.
* `Untitled2.py`: Web server that accepts POST requests and stores the received keystrokes in a text file.

## How It Works

1. The client opens a GUI window (fake game) using Tkinter.
2. A background thread uses `pynput` to monitor keyboard input.
3. Once 50 characters are captured, the data is sent via HTTP POST to the configured server.
4. The server writes received keystrokes to `log.txt`.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Modules: `pynput`, `requests`, `flask`

Install them with:

```
pip install pynput requests flask
```

## Setup

### Server (`Untitled2.py`)

1. Edit the file and ensure the line `app.run(host="", port=80)` is configured with a proper host IP if needed (e.g., `0.0.0.0`).
2. Run the server:

```
python Untitled2.py
```

The server will listen for POST requests at `/log.php`.

### Client (`Untitled.py`)

1. Set the `SERVIDOR` variable to your server's address:

```python
SERVIDOR = "http://<your-server-ip>/log.php"
```

2. Run the script:

```
python Untitled.py
```

The GUI window will appear. Keyboard input will be logged in the background.

## Notes

* This is a demonstration for controlled environments.
* All use must comply with applicable laws and must be authorized.
* The client currently does not persist logs locally.
* There is no encryption between client and server.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Only use in environments where all users are informed and have provided consent.
